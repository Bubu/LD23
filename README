You are a genie trapped on the world in a bottle, trying to get out.

Find all the keys to unlock the three doors guarding the exit. 
... beware of the efreets!

Controls: 
 - WASD or arrow keys to walk
 - Space to jump (kinda useless, but looks funny :-))
 - Ctrl to shoot white pixels (which don't do anything...)
 - Esc to go to the menu. Second entry is the close button.
 
 - Gamepads should work, but some may have confusing button layouts.


The game could have used quite a bit more work, but is playable and the first level should be completable.
